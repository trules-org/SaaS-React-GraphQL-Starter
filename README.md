 # SaaS-Starter for React & GraphQL
This project is intended to create example components for any MVP (Minimum Viable Product) SaaS offering.
Every SaaS offering requires at a minumum a secure server and a secure client. This project will implement both using [Node.jsÂ®](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) and Facebook's [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) with [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) GraphQL client and server tools as the base technologies.

The server API will be GraphQL based, and will include both secure HTTP and Websocket examples. The client will be React based and demonstrate Registration, Login and Subscription-based updates.
